# StickyStencil
A sticky note holder along with a stencil to make Todo list making extra easy! It also helps people stay organized throughout the day.

The plan was for this to hold standard stickynotes in a small frame, then add a stencil in a slot near it to make it easy to generate lists. The stencil will have checkboxes and lines to make a list. The goal for this entire project is to make daily tasks faster to track and accomplish. This project was created by remembering the (and using them daily) 3d printed sticky note stencils I have seen online. While making the draft, I struggled on deciding on where to put the stencils.

As this project continued on, I realized that there is a lot wrong with the initial design, and decided for this instead. This is the final project:
