Timeline - Total time: 

Sectional Analysis <br>
I learned sectional analysis to make sure the parts would fit together nicely, and I ran into an issue. The stencil fit at the bottom, but at the top, they were the exact same size. To fix it, I tried to create some more room by still keeping walls thick, and nothing worked. I eventually just made the wells thinner from 3mm to about 1.5mm now. They should remain fairly strong and have no load under them, so this should be fine. Now, I just polish some stuff up and I'll be done!

These are images of everything so far, and I probably won't change a lot from here because I really like how it's looking right now.

Stencil Portion and Slideability<br>
After making the base of the StickyStencil, I had to make the stencil portion. This was one of the most important parts of the project, and I had to make sure that the stencil was perfect for making good lists that would work in a variety of scenarios, ensuring that I could actually use it. To start, I made the stencil part and just worked on the spacing and cutouts. This took a lot of time because it required me to learn some new functions in Fusion that I hadn't used before. From there, I had to learn how to use specific cutout tools such as shell, fillet, and more to make this a good print. After making the stencil good, I had to make the drawer portion on the base itself. Lining it up and making sure tolerance was good was a big part and time consumer and quite challenging for a beginner like me. Alas, I did it, and I'm pretty happy with the result! From now, I just probably have to use sectional analysis (I'll have to learn that) and other tools to just polish it up a little bit and make it ready for submission!

This is the current state of the project:

Drafts and the Base Model<br>
I started working on the idea of the StickyStencil today. The plan is for it to hold standard stickynotes in a small frame, then add a stencil in a slot near it to make it easy to generate lists. The stencil will have checkboxes and lines to make a list. The goal for this entire project is to make daily tasks faster to track and accomplish. This project was created by remembering the (and using them daily) 3d printed sticky note stencils I have seen online. While making the draft, I struggled on deciding on where to put the stencils.

This is the rough draft:

After I started working on it, I ran into some other problems, such as the hinge not working and being bulky for what I wanted. Instead, I found a better solution: use a pullout tab under the stick notes for easy use and access. I have designed the main body now, and here is what it looks like:

It required a lot of brainstorming and iterative designing, making sure that it works well and is logical. Due to this, it took up a lot of my time and effort, but I'm really excited for the end result of this project now.
